# VibeStream

## The Idea
An app that matches your music to your mood. Just open the app, and it'll suggest music that fits how you're feeling right now.

## Why I'm Building This
I'm always spending too much time figuring out what to listen to. Sometimes I just want music that matches my current vibe without having to think about it.

## Current Thoughts
- Maybe use the phone camera to detect facial expressions?
- Could also just have mood buttons (Happy, Sad, Energetic, Chill, etc.)
- Need to figure out what APIs to use for music recommendations
- Probably should start with a simple prototype

## Questions I Have
- Would people actually use this?
- How would it be different from regular music apps?
- Is the mood detection thing technically possible for me to build?

## Next Steps
- Should probably talk to some friends who are into music
- Need to research music APIs (Spotify? Apple Music?)
- Maybe sketch out some UI ideas
