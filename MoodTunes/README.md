# MoodTunes

## Vision
MoodTunes is an AI-powered music recommendation app that creates personalized playlists based on your current mood, activities, and preferences. The app aims to eliminate the decision fatigue associated with finding the right music for every moment.

## The Problem
Music lovers spend too much time searching for the right songs that match their current mood, activity, or environment. Existing music apps provide generic recommendations that don't adapt to the user's immediate context, leading to decision fatigue and a disconnected listening experience.

## Target Audience
We've identified three key user segments through our research:

1. **Busy Professionals** (25-40 year olds)
   - Need quick access to appropriate music without disrupting workflow
   - Frustrated by decision fatigue and time wasted searching for the right playlist

2. **Fitness Enthusiasts**
   - Need dynamic playlists that match workout intensity and type
   - Struggle with having to manually switch playlists during different workout phases

3. **Casual Listeners**
   - Need easy discovery of new music that matches their taste and current activity
   - Often feel overwhelmed by choices or stuck in musical ruts

## Validation Progress
Through interviews with 12 potential users, we've learned:
- 9/12 users report spending 5+ minutes finding the right music for different situations
- Most users (10/12) rely on saved playlists rather than exploring new music
- Privacy concerns exist but are outweighed by convenience for most users
- Integration with existing music services is highly desired (mentioned by all users)

## Current Solution Direction
Our approach focuses on:
1. **Simple Mood Input Interface** - Emoji-based interface for quick mood selection
2. **Contextual Awareness** - Using time, location, and activity data to enhance recommendations
3. **Streaming Service Integration** - Working with existing music libraries rather than creating our own

## Technical Exploration
- Exploring APIs: Spotify Web API, Apple Music API, YouTube Music API
- Tech stack considering: React Native for mobile app, Node.js backend, TensorFlow for mood detection
- Key challenges include accurate mood detection, API limitations, and privacy considerations

## Next Steps
1. Complete assumption validation through landing page test
2. Build functional prototype focusing on the mood input interface
3. Develop technical POC for the recommendation algorithm
4. Explore partnerships with music streaming services
